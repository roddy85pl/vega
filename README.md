1. At the command prompt, navigate to the Vega Video Sample App source code directory. 

2. To install the app dependencies, run the following command. 

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. To build the app to generate .vpkg files, run the following command.

   ```
   npm run build:app
   ```

4. At the command prompt, in the **build** folder, verify that you generated the VPKG files for your device's architecture.

   * **armv7-release/keplervideoapp_armv7.vpkg**&mdash;generated on x86_64 and Mac-M series devices to run on the Vega OS Fire TV Stick.
   * **x86_64-release/keplervideoapp_x86_64.vpkg**&mdash;generated on x86_64 device to run on the VVD.
   * **aarch64-release/keplervideoapp_aarch64.vpkg**&mdash;generated on Mac M-series device to run on the VVD.

Advanced features
-----------------

### Upload custom search data for your app

You can upload a sample JSON file to a specified location and search the data from the uploaded file. If you upload the file, the search only uses the data from the file. If you do not upload the file, the search uses the existing data from the Home screen video tiles.

1. Create a JSON file with search data based on the following structure. 

   File name: **KVATestData.json**

   Path: **/home/app_user/packages/com.amazondeveloper.keplervideoapp/data**

   **JSON structure**   
     
   ```json
   [
     {
       "medias": [
         {
           "uri": "string",
           "categories": ["string"],
           "channelID": "string",

### W3C Media APIs

The Vega Video Sample App uses Vega's W3C Media API (`@amazon-devices/react-native-w3cmedia`) for video playback and demonstrates some of its features:

- [Adaptive Streaming Playback](#adaptive-streaming-playback)
- [Pre-buffering](#pre-buffering)
- [Custom UI](#custom-ui)

**Comprehensive W3C Media API documentation**

- [W3C Media API in React Native for Vega](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega/0.21/media-player.html) - Complete API reference and concepts.
- [Media Player Setup](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega/0.21/media-player-setup.html) - Step-by-step implementation instructions.

#### Adaptive streaming playback

Adaptive streaming playback is a core feature of the W3C Media API. You can try out these different file types by using [VideoFileType.tsx](src/components/VideoFileType.tsx) found on the [Details screen](src/screens/DetailsScreen.tsx).

To use the W3C Media API for adaptive streaming, you need a separate Media Source Extension (MSE) player. In the Video Sample app, the [Shaka Player](#shaka-player) is used.

**Detailed implementation guides**

To use the W3C Media API for adaptive streaming, you need a separate Media Source Extension (MSE) player. In the Video Sample app, the [Shaka Player](#shaka-player) is used.

**Detailed implementation guides**

- [Play adaptive content using Hls.js Player](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega/0.21/media-player-hls-player.html) - Complete guide for HTTP Live Streaming.

#### Pre-buffering

Pre-buffering allows video content to be loaded outside of the player component. In the Video Sample App, pre-buffering begins on the [Details screen](src/screens/DetailsScreen.tsx#L45). This allows the video to start loading before the user reaches the [Player screen](src/screens/PlayerScreen.tsx). This greatly decreases how long the user has to wait for the video to start. The utility class [VideoHandler.ts](src/utils/VideoHandler.ts) handles pre-buffering and its clean-up functions.

#### Custom UI

The W3C Media API allows you to hide the standard UI and display your own UI on top of the video player. In the Video Sample App, a [custom UI](src/w3cmedia/mediacontrols/VideoPlayerUI.tsx) was created to demonstrate this. The buttons of this custom UI connect to the `VideoPlayer` object and trigger the appropriate actions.

#### Shaka Player

Shaka Player is a JavaScript (JS) player created for adaptive streaming on the web. The architecture of the W3C Media API allows this web player to also be used in Vega apps. A port of the Shaka player's code is included in [`src/w3cmedia/shakaplayer`](src/w3cmedia/shakaplayer). A helper function [ShakaPlayer.ts](src/w3cmedia/shakaplayer/ShakaPlayer.ts) was created to instantiate the Shaka player class and link it to the W3C Media API.

**For implementing the Shaka Player in your own projects**, we recommend following the comprehensive [Play adaptive content (HLS/DASH) with Shaka Player](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega/0.21/media-player-shaka-player.html) document. This document provides detailed implementation instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting tips specific to the Vega platform.

### In-App Purchasing

The In-App Purchasing (IAP) API allows apps to present, process, and fulfill purchases of digital content and subscriptions within the app. The Video Sample App demonstrates a simple use-case of the IAP APIs through the "Purchase Subscription" button on the Details Screen.

The IAP implementation for the Video Sample App references the [IAP Sample App](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega/0.21/use-iap-vega-sample.html) to showcase a simple purchasing transaction for monthly subscriptions. For other in-depth IAP features, you can explore the IAP Sample App.

#### Set up IAP

Prior set up is needed to utilize the IAP APIs and handle transactions properly. This set up is required every time the VVD or device is launched. Please follow the [IAP documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega/0.21/vega-iap-overview.html) to onboard and set up the [IAP Tester App](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega/0.21/configure-app-tester.html). You can reference the IAP documentation and follow the formats to properly configure the IAP environment.

### Content Launcher integration

To learn more, see [Get Started with Linear TV](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega/0.21/get-started-with-linear-tv.html).


### Focus management

Focus management is critical for TV apps as users navigate using remote controls rather than touch input. The Vega Video Sample App implements a comprehensive focus management system to ensure intuitive navigation.

#### How to provide initial focus

Initial focus can be specified by your app using the `hasTVPreferredFocus` props. This is essential because TV users need a clear starting point when entering a screen.

Example:

```javascript
<ImageBackground style={styles.imageBackgroundContainer}>
  {/* BackButton is a wrapper component over primitive React Native component */}
  <BackButton
    overrideStyle={styles.backButton}
    hasTVPreferredFocus={true}
    onPress={navigateBack}
  />
  <View style={styles.content}>
    <Text style={styles.titleText} numberOfLines={1}>
      {route.params.data.title}
    </Text>
  </View>
</ImageBackground>
```

**Why this pattern is used**

- **TV navigation requirements**: Unlike mobile apps, TV apps require explicit focus management because users can't tap directly on elements.
- **User experience**: Setting initial focus prevents users from having to navigate blindly to find the first interactive element.
- **Accessibility**: Ensures screen readers and other assistive technologies have a clear starting point.
- **Platform consistency**: Follows Vega OS Fire TV Stick platform guidelines for focus behavior.


#### FocusableElement component pattern

The Video Sample App uses a custom `FocusableElement` component that wraps `TouchableOpacity` to provide consistent focus behavior.

Example: 

```javascript
const FocusableElement = ({
  hasTVPreferredFocus,
  onFocusOverrideStyle,
  style,
  onFocus,
  onBlur,
  ...otherProps
}) => {
  const [isFocused, setIsFocused] = useState(false);

  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      hasTVPreferredFocus={hasTVPreferredFocus}
      style={[style, isFocused ? onFocusOverrideStyle : undefined]}
      onFocus={() => setIsFocused(true)}
      onBlur={() => setIsFocused(false)}
      {...otherProps}
    />
  );
};
```

**Implementation rationale**

- **Visual feedback**: Provides clear visual indication when elements are focused.
- **Consistent styling**: Ensures all focusable elements follow the same focus styling patterns.
- **State management**: Tracks focus state for conditional rendering and styling.
- **Reusability**: Single component handles focus logic across the entire app.

### Platform-specific implementations

The Video Sample App uses `Platform.isTV` checks throughout the codebase to provide optimized experiences for different device types.

#### Feature availability based on platform

```javascript
// AppConfig.ts - Feature flags based on platform capabilities
const isContentPersonalizationEnabled = () => {
  return !isSimulator && Platform.isTV;
};

const isInAppPurchaseEnabled = () => {
  return Platform.isTV;
};

const isAccountLoginEnabled = () => {
  return Platform.isTV;
};
```

**Why platform-specific feature flags are used**

- **Hardware limitations**: Some features like IAP are only available on actual TV devices.
- **VVD constraints**: Content Personalization requires real device capabilities not available in VVD.
- **Performance optimization**: Prevents unnecessary service initialization on unsupported platforms.
- **Development efficiency**: Allows testing core functionality even when platform services aren't available.

#### Adaptive video resolution

Example:

```javascript
// VideoHandler.ts - Resolution optimization based on device capabilities
const DEFAULT_ABR_WIDTH: number = Platform.isTV ? 3840 : 1919;
const DEFAULT_ABR_HEIGHT: number = Platform.isTV ? 2160 : 1079;
```

**Implementation reasoning**

- **TV optimization**: TV devices can handle 4K (3840x2160) resolution for optimal viewing experience.
- **Resource management**: Non-TV devices use lower resolution to conserve bandwidth and processing power.
- **Adaptive bitrate**: Ensures smooth playback across different device capabilities.

#### Navigation behavior differences

Example:

```javascript
// MovieGrid.tsx - Different scroll behavior for TV vs mobile
<ScrollView
  horizontal={!Platform.isTV}
  scrollEnabled={!Platform.isTV}
  showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
>
```

**Why different navigation patterns**

- **TV interface design**: TV interfaces typically use vertical navigation to match remote control D-pad behavior.
- **Mobile optimization**: Mobile devices benefit from horizontal scrolling for content discovery.
- **User expectations**: Each platform has established UX patterns that users expect.

### Splash screen management

The Video Sample App implements sophisticated splash screen management to ensure smooth app startup across different environments.

#### Development vs production behavior

Example:

```javascript
// App.tsx - Conditional splash screen handling
const App = () => {
  const isTv = Platform.isTV;
  const preventHideSplashScreen = usePreventHideSplashScreen;
  const hideSplashScreen = useHideSplashScreenCallback();

  if (isTv) {
    preventHideSplashScreen();
  }

  if (__DEV__) {
    hideSplashScreen();
  }
};
```

**Implementation rationale**

- **TV launch requirements**: TV apps must prevent splash screen from hiding until app is fully ready.
- **Development efficiency**: Debug builds hide splash screen immediately to speed up development iteration.
- **User experience**: Production builds show splash screen until content is loaded and ready for interaction.
- **Platform compliance**: Meets Vega OS Fire TV Stick platform requirements for app launch behavior.

### Error handling strategy

The Video Sample App implements a centralized error handling approach with user-friendly error displays.

#### ErrorView component pattern

Example:

```javascript
// ErrorView.tsx - Consistent error display across the app
const ErrorView = ({navigateBack}) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.mainContainer}>
      <Header navigateBack={navigateBack} />
      <View style={styles.errorContainer}>
        <Typography variant={'title'} color={COLORS.WHITE}>
          {ErrorMsg}
        </Typography>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};
```

**Why this error handling approach**

- **User experience**: Provides clear, actionable error messages instead of app crashes.
- **Navigation consistency**: Maintains header with back button so users can always return.
- **Visual consistency**: Uses the design system of the app for error states.
- **Graceful degradation**: Allows the app to continue functioning even when specific features fail.

### react-native-navigation

 **WARNING**: Due to a recent dependency update in React Navigation, you are now required to add `"@amazon-devices/react-native-screens": "~2.0.0"` as a dependency for any package that uses React Navigation. If you don’t add the dependency, the app crashes.


**To integrate this library**

1. In your **package.json** file, add the subset of VegaUIReact-Navigation dependencies that are needed to support your app.
    
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
      ...
      "@amazon-devices/react-native-safe-area-context": "~2.0.0",
      "@amazon-devices/react-navigation__routers": "~7.0.0",
      "@amazon-devices/react-navigation__core": "~7.0.0",

2. In your React Native for Vega app's **manifest.toml**, add `com.amazon.network.service` to `wants.service`.
    
   ```text
   [[wants.service]]
   id = "com.amazon.network.service"
   ```
   
3. In your React Native for Vega app's **manifest.toml**, add API permission to `needs.privilege`. 
   
   ```text
   [needs]
   [[needs.privilege]]
   id="com.amazon.network.privilege.net-info"
   ```
   
4. To reinstall the dependencies, run the `npm install` command.

5. Import the corresponding `NetInfo` component.
    
   ```typescript
   import {NetInfoStateType, fetch} from "@amazon-devices/keplerscript-netmgr-lib";
   ```

6. To get the network status, use the fetch method.

   ```typescript
   fetch().then(state => {
       console.log("is connected? " + state.isConnected);
       if (state.type === NetInfoStateType.wifi) {
         console.log("ssid is " + state.details.ssid);
       }
   });
   ```

### react-native-device-info

**To integrate this library**

1. In your **package.json** file, add the following package dependency. 

   ```json
   "dependencies": {
      ...
      "@amazon-devices/react-native-device-info": "~2.0.0"
   }
   ```   

2. To reinstall the dependencies, run the `npm install` command.

3. Usage.
    
   ```typescript
   import DeviceInfo from '@amazon-devices/react-native-device-info';

   // or ES6+ destructured imports

   import { getBaseOs } from '@amazon-devices/react-native-device-info';
   ```
     

#### API
Most of the functions return a Promise, but also have a corresponding function with Sync on the end that operates synchronously. For example, you might prefer to call `getBaseOsSync()` when your app initializes the operating system (OS) to avoid async calls during the first parts of the app startup.

**Note**: Values used in examples don't represent the actual output.

#### getBaseOs()
The base OS build that the device is based on.

The following example shows how to call `getBaseOsSync()` to return the base OS build.
    
 ```typescript
DeviceInfo.getBaseOs().then((baseOs) => {
  // "Vega"
});
```

### reduxjs toolkit

The Redux Toolkit (RTK) is a library to help you code Redux apps. The `@reduxjs/toolkit` package wraps around the core Redux package, and contains API methods and common dependencies that are essential for you to build a Redux app. The toolkit implements best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, and prevents common mistakes.

**To integrate this library**

1. In your **package.json** file, add the following package dependencies. 
    
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
      ...
      "@reduxjs/toolkit": "2.2.4",
      "react-redux": "9.1.2",
   }
   ```

2. To reinstall the dependencies, run the `npm install` command.

3. In the `features/counter/counterSlice.ts` file, define slice state and action types.

   1. Import `createSlice`, `PayloadAction`, `RootState`.

      ```typescript
      import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
      import type { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
      import type { RootState } from '../../app/store';
      ```
    
   2. Usage.
    
      ```typescript
      // Define a type for the slice state.
      interface CounterState {
        value: number;
      }

      // Define the initial state using that type.
      const initialState: CounterState = {
        value: 0,
      };

      export const counterSlice = createSlice({
        name: 'counter',
        // `createSlice` infers the state type from the `initialState` argument.
        initialState,
        reducers: {
          increment: (state) => {
            state.value += 1;
          },
          decrement: (state) => {
            state.value -= 1;
          },
          // Use the PayloadAction type to declare the contents of `action.payload`.
          incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
            state.value += action.payload;
          },
        },
      });

      export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

      // Other code such as selectors can use the imported `RootState` type.
      export const selectCount = (state: RootState) => state.counter.value;

      export default counterSlice.reducer;
      ```   
 
4. In the **app/store.ts** file, define root state and dispatch types.

   1. Import `configureStore`.
    
      ```typescript
      import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
      import counterReducer from './features/counter/counterSlice';
      ```
       
   2. Usage.  
    
      ```typescript
      export const store = configureStore({
           reducer: {
                counter: counterReducer,
           },
      });

      // Infer the `RootState` and `AppDispatch` types from the store itself.
      export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
      // Inferred type: {posts: PostsState, comments: CommentsState, users: UsersState}.
      export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
      ```

### lodash

**To integrate this library**

1. In your **package.json** file, add the following package dependency. 

   ```json
   "dependencies": {
      ...
      "lodash": "^4.17.21",
   }
   ```

2. To reinstall the dependencies, run the `npm install` command.

3. Import the corresponding `isEqual` method.
    
   ```typescript
   import {isEqual} from 'lodash';
   ``` 

4. The `isEqual` function performs a deep comparison between two values to determine if they are equivalent.

   ```typescript
   Example;

   const obj1 = {a: 1, b: {c: 2}};
   const obj2 = {a: 1, b: {c: 2}};

   // Comparing two objects.
   console.log(isEqual(obj1, obj2));
   // Output: true (obj1 and obj2 are deeply equal).

   const translations: any = {
        en,
   };

   export const appLocales = ['en-US'];

   export const getCurrentCountry = () => {
        return getCountry();
   };

   export const getAppLocales = () => {
        const filteredLocales = getLocales().filter((locale) => {
             return appLocales.includes(locale.languageTag);
        });
        return filteredLocales;
   };

   export const translate = (key: string) => {

Known Issues
------------

The following sections list known issues with the Vega Video Sample App.

### Feature Rotator

The Feature Rotator is intended to be auto-rotating only, and is not meant to be interacted with by the user. D-Pad commands have no effect on the feature rotator, and any Touch interactions might cause unintended behaviors for the component.

### Nonfunctional buttons on the Details screen

Some of the buttons on the Details screen are nonfunctional, and are added as visual examples. They are for your Sample only.

The following list shows some of the nonfunctional buttons on the Details screen:

- Play Trailer
- Add to List

### Player screen

**Caption menu resets when you close it**

By default, the Caption menu has the first option selected when it opens. This can lead to a mismatch between the actual caption that is displayed and the one that appears to be selected on the Caption menu.

For example, let’s say that you turn off captions by selecting the Off option, and then you close the Caption menu. When you reopen the Caption menu, the first caption appears selected even though the captions are actually off. You can’t re-enable the first caption option because it appears to already be selected on the Caption menu.

In this scenario—when you switch to a new caption after you close the Caption menu—Amazon recommends that you first set the caption to the Off option. Then, switch to the option you want.


**Player control buttons have inconsistent behavior**

Buttons such as the Fast Forward, Rewind, Play, and Pause button might behave differently depending on the currently playing file type. As a result, you might notice out-of-sync behavior when you interact with these buttons. For example, when you press the Fast Forward or Rewind buttons, the video might continue to play but the UI button still shows the Paused button.

The following list shows more examples of inconsistent Player screen UI behavior:

- Fast Forward and Rewind buttons start video playback even when video is paused, for certain non-MP4 file types.
- Fast Forward and Rewind buttons don’t have any effect when the video is paused, for MP4 file types.

When these buttons become out of sync with the video playback (for example, UI shows Paused button but the video continues to play), Amazon recommends that you press the Play/Pause button a few times until the buttons are accurate and in-sync with the playback.

**Video not loading or app crashing during playback**

Occasionally when you try to navigate to the video player, the video content never fully loads. In this case, you see a never-ending loading indicator. In rare cases, the app might crash. In either of these cases, Amazon recommends that you relaunch the app. If the issue persists, there might be a problem with the video content source.

**App shows black screen with only audio playback**

When you play a video from the detail page after performing back navigation from the player, occasionally a black screen appears with only audio playback.

The recommended workaround is to click the back button on the remote control or the screen navigation. The home page is displayed, and you can start or select another video.

### In-App Purchasing API stability

The In-App Purchasing APIs can be unstable. The following list shows common issues you might encounter:

* **Unresponsive IAP APIs**&mdash;For example, when you press the Purchase Subscription button on the Details Screen, nothing happens.
* **Unresponsive IAP UI**&mdash;When you navigate to the IAP UI, you might be unable to interact with the UI to continue the IAP transaction. The unresponsiveness might resolve itself after some time. Restart the app if the issue persists.
* **General intermittent error responses from the IAP client**&mdash;When you initiate an IAP transaction and navigate to the IAP UI, issues can occur that involve the communication between the Vega Video Sample App and the IAP Tester App that result in error messages.


When you encounter any disruptive issues with IAP, Amazon recommends that you restart the Vega Video Sample App and the IAP Tester App. In some cases, you might also need to restart the Vega Virtual Device or Vega OS Fire TV Stick, and repeat the IAP setup.
